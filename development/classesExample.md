# Instructions

The material for this lesson is based on [Chapter 15:  Classes and Objects --- the Basics](https://learnpythontherightway.com/chapter/chapter-15.html).

For this lesson, you will be required to complete the  exercises below. 

Make sure to write your solutions in the `main.py` file.

1.  Rewrite the `distance` function from the chapter titled *Fruitful functions* so that it takes two 
    `Point`s as parameters instead of four numbers.

2.  Add a method `reflect_x` to `Point` which returns a new `Point`, one which is the reflection of the point 
    about the x-axis. For example, `Point(3, 5).reflect_x()` is (3, -5)

3.  Add a method `slope_from_origin` which returns the slope of the line joining the origin to the point. For 
    example:

```python
>>> Point(4, 10).slope_from_origin()
2.5 
```    

What cases will cause this method to fail?

4.  The equation of a straight line is "y = ax + b", (or perhaps "y = mx + c"). The coefficients a and b completely describe the line. Write a method in the `Point` class so that if a point instance is given another point, it will compute the equation of the straight ine joining the two points. It must return the two coefficients as a tuple of two values. For example, :

```python
>>> print(Point(4, 11).get_line_to(Point(6, 15))) 
>>> (2, 3)
```

This tells us that the equation of the line joining the two points is "y = 2x + 3". When will this method fail?

5.  Given four points that fall on the circumference of a circle, find the midpoint of the circle. When will this function fail?

  *Hint:* You *must* know how to solve the geometry problem *before* you think of going anywhere near programming. You cannot program a solution to a problem if you don't understand what you want the
  computer to do!

6.  Create a new class, SMS\_store. The class will instantiate SMS\_store objects, similar to an inbox or outbox on a cellphone:

```python
my_inbox = SMS_store()
```

This store can hold multiple SMS messages (i.e. its internal state will just be a list of messages). Each message will be represented as a tuple:

```python
(has_been_viewed, from_number, time_arrived, text_of_SMS) 
```

The inbox object should provide these methods:

```python
my_inbox.add_new_arrival(from_number, time_arrived, text_of_SMS)    
  # Makes new SMS tuple, inserts it after other messages 
  # in the store. When creating this message, its 
  # has_been_viewed status is set False.

my_inbox.message_count()         
  # Returns the number of sms messages in my_inbox

my_inbox.get_unread_indexes()    
  # Returns list of indexes of all not-yet-viewed SMS messages

my_inbox.get_message(i)          
  # Return (from_number, time_arrived, text_of_sms) for message[i]
  # Also change its state to "has been viewed".
  # If there is no message at position i, return None

my_inbox.delete(i)     # Delete the message at index i
my_inbox.clear()       # Delete all messages from inbox
```

Write the class, create a message store object, write tests for these methods, and implement the methods.
